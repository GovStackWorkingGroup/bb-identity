# ID-Related BB Common Terminology

### Consent Building Block (CBB)

The Consent Building Block enables services for individuals to approve the use of their Personal Data by defining the principles, functions, and architecture of an information system. For organisations that process Personal Data​,​ it provides the ability to know the ​individual's will and legitimately process such Personal Data. The Consent Building Block is a process-oriented GovStack Building Block facilitating auditable bilateral agreements within a multi-agent environment that integrates with most other Building Blocks.

### Credential

A set of data presented as evidence of a claimed identity and/or entitlements. ([ITU-T X.1252](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.1252))\
It may include an identifier to uniquely identify the credential, as well as metadata that describes properties of the credential itself such as the issuer, the expiry time, a representative image, etc.

### Digital Credentials <a href="#digital-credential" id="digital-credential"></a>

A Digital Credential (also known as a verifiable credential) is a digitally-issued and verifiable form of a claim or a set of claims made by a (single) issuer. Digital Credentials can be shared, verified, and stored securely offering advantages over physical equivalents. Digital Credentials are often cryptographically verifiable meaning their authenticity can be easily checked by Verifiers.See also related terminology for Credential and Verifiable Credentials.

### e-Signature Building Block (eSBB) <a href="#digital-credential-wallet" id="digital-credential-wallet"></a>

eSignature Building Block provides the necessary functionalities to bring handwritten signatures to the digital world. Handwritten signatures have served as a way to agree/witness a given document, yet, in today's digital world most documents are in digital form. The digital form varies between structured (XML, JSON) and unstructured documents (PDF, Word, Image, CSV, Spreadsheet).  eSignatures can be added to digital documents similar to handwritten signatures achieving the same functionality.<br>

### Identity Building Block (IDBB)

Identity Building Block as specified in current documentation.

In charge to create, manage life cycle, audit mechanisms, and verify identities.

### Legal Entity

is an organisation (public or private) ​that has the rights and obligations to define standards for Personal Data processing. E.g. a public health authority

### **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** <a href="#pii-personally-identifiable-information" id="pii-personally-identifiable-information"></a>

PII refers to any information that can be used to identify a specific individual, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, or biometric data.

### Trust

The confidence of one party or entity that another party or entity will behave in a well-defined way that does not violate agreed-upon rules, policies or legal clauses of the identity management system. ([ITU-T X.1252](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.1252))



### **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** <a href="#verifiable-credentials-vcs" id="verifiable-credentials-vcs"></a>

Verifiable credentials are digital statements that attest to the truth of certain claims. They are issued, held, and presented in a secure and privacy-preserving manner.See also related terminology for Credential and Digital Credential.

### Wallet Building Block (WBB)

Wallet as a term can mean many things depending on your background and context. However with GovStack we have chosen to use Wallet in its widest context, as a **Container** with **Content**.

Therefore the total scope and focus of the Wallet Building Block (WBB) is to provide specifications which support multiple forms of Containers and Contents, we have chosen this abstraction to ensure that the Building Block remains inclusive of different formats of Wallets.
